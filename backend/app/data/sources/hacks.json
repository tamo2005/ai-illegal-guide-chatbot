    "content": "If you've lost your original documents or they're stuck in verification, you can still secure college admission through these steps: 1) Get a police FIR for lost documents immediately. 2) Apply for duplicate certificates from your board/university - this usually takes 2-3 weeks. 3) Most colleges accept provisional admission with photocopies and an affidavit stating originals will be submitted within 30 days. 4) Submit a written application to the college explaining your situation with the FIR copy. 5) Pay a refundable security deposit (usually 10,000-25,000 rupees) which is returned when you submit originals. 6) Get a letter from your previous institution confirming your enrollment and marks. This approach works in 80% of cases, especially in private colleges.",

The key is to demonstrate your genuine student status through multiple documents.",
